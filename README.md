# 8 ways to solve 8-puzzle - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
This project implements and compairs different seach methods applied to the 8-puzzle problem.

## The following Algorithms have been implemented to solve the problem:

### Uninformed Search
- Breadth-first search
- Iterative deepening search
- Uniform-cost search

### Informed Search
- A* search
- Greedy best-first search

Each informed search algorithm uses the following heuristics:
- Number of misplaced tiles
- Manhattan distance

### Local Search
- Hill Climbing
